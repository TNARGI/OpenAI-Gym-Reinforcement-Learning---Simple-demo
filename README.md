# OpenAI-Gym-Reinforcement-Learning---Simple-demo
Hovering Ball modified from OpenAI Gym's CartPole Agent/Environment

Description: Two similar projects, 'ball hover' and 'ball control'. Ball hover employes a reinforcement learning agent to optimise the input of upwards force on a 'ball' affected by gravity, such that its position remains within specific vertical boundaries. Ball control extends this functionality by adding a second dimension to the observation and action space.

Running Instructions: This project was built and run on an Ubuntu virtual machine with a fresh installation of python3.6.9. It is therefore recommended that the same conditions are observed for replicaton. With PIP and python installed, use PIP to install numpy, keras and powerai gym. Before running 'ballhovertrial.py' and 'ballcontroltrial.py' it is necessary to install the environments. In the terminal, navigate to the top-level directory 'ball_hover' and execute the command 'pip install -e .'
